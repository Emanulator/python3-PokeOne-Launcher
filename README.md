# Python3 PokeOne Launcher

For the Players who don´t use Windows. (Windows is supported by this Launcher, but you should use the official one instead)

May require wine (or wine-staging) and DXVK installed on your linux machine for the actual game to run.

It installs the required Python packages automatically.

I dont know? I have only tested this on a few Machines.

## Can i request a feature?
No.

## How do i run this on linux?
If you don´t know how to run a python script, maybe you shouldn´t use linux.
