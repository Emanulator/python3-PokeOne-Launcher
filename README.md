# Python3 PokeOne Launcher

For the Players who donÂ´t use Windows. (Windows is supported by this Launcher, but you should use the official one instead)

**Requires wine (or wine-staging) and DXVK installed on your linux machine for the actual game to run.**

It installs the required Python packages automatically. **(needs python-pip installed)**

# Questions that may be asked:

## Is this allowed by the Devs of the Game?
Good question! I never asked them. If they want this removed, i will remove it.

## Why does it not work?
Since I have only tested this on a few Machines, i cannot guarantee that it will run on some specific configurations.

## How do i run this on linux?
Read the Requirements above, downlaod this repo, extract it to a new folder, then from a terminal: "chmod +x launch.sh" (without quotation marks) and then run launch.sh




# Updates
 August 2022: Added an option to run with gamemode (if installed), but i have no idea if this brings better performance.
